Multiple diagnoses may need to be ruled out prior to coming up with the correct solution for the cough.  Note that all of these conditions may present with cough alone without any other clinical clues as to the diagnosis.\n\n\nUpper Airway Cough Syndrome (UACS)\n\nFor upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), empiric therapy with a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant combination should first be attempted.  If the syndrome is suspected but patient does not respond, the patient should undergo sinus imaging to rule out chronic sinusitis.  Nasopharyngoscopy could also be considered.\n\n\nAsthma\n\nAsthma evaluation may include spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility testing, bronchoprovocation challenge, and allergy evaluation/empiric treatment.  Treatment for asthma may include inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), bronchodilators, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and trigger avoidance.\n\n\nNon-Asthmatic Eosinophilic Bronchitis (NAEB)\n\nNon-asthmatic eosinpholic bronchitis (NAEB) can be considered after ruling out asthma.  Diagnosis is by demonstration of sputum eosinophilia, either with an expectorated sample or via a sample obtained via bronchoscopy.  Treatment includes inhaled corticosteroids and trigger avoidance.\n\n\nGERD\n\nGERD can be empirically treated with a proton-pump inhibitor.  However, since not all reflux disease is caused by gastric acid, treatment must include lifestyle changes.  Such lifestyle changes include a low-fat diet, avoidance of caffeine, citrus products, tomatoes, alcohol, smoking, limiting vigorous exercise that increases intraabdominal pressure.  If it is unclear if GERD is the cause of cough, 24 hour esophageal pH monitoring/impedence monitoring may be considered.  If none of the above treatments are effective and pH monitoring indicates reflux, antireflux surgery may need to be considered.\n\nConsider referral to either Pulmonology, ENT, GI, and/or Allergy as appropriate.")
