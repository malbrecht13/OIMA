Recheck of a microscopic urinalysis is indicated after treatment/resolution, which can be performed 3 weeks later.  If a medical-renal disease is suspected, refer to nephrology.

Options are to repeat a urinalysis within 6 months OR perform a cystoscopy and renal ultrasound now.  Refer to urology if cystoscopy is to be performed.  If the patient decides to simply repeat a UA, if the subsequent UA shows microscopic hematuria the patient should now be reclassified as either intermediate or high risk.",

If both CT and MR urography are contraindicated, consider retrograde pyelogram with either noncontrast CT/noncontrast MR or renal ultrasound.  Refer to urology."
