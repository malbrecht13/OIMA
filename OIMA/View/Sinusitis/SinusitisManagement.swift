 Defintions:
 
 acute viral URI = considered if there is lack of purulence
 acute rhinosinusitis = purulent sinusitis + either nasal obstruction or facial symptoms or both
 acute viral rhinosinusitis = acute rhinosinusitis that doesn't meet bacterial definition
 acute bacterial rhinosinusitis = acute rhinosinusitis that doesn't start to improve over 10 days, or improves but then gets worse within 10 days
 acute bacterial rhinosinusitis with complication suspected = acute bacterial rhinosinusitis with proptosis, periorbital swelling, cranial nerve palsy, and/or severe headache
 
 chronic rhinosinusitis - presence of two or more symptoms of sinusitis for greater than 12 weeks, plus signs of inflammation such as turbinate edema,
