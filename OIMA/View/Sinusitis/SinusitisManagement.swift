 Defintions:
 
 acute viral URI = considered if there is lack of purulence
 acute rhinosinusitis = purulent sinusitis + either nasal obstruction or facial symptoms or both
 acute viral rhinosinusitis = acute rhinosinusitis that doesn't meet bacterial definition
 acute bacterial rhinosinusitis = acute rhinosinusitis that doesn't start to improve over 10 days, or improves but then gets worse within 10 days
 acute bacterial rhinosinusitis with complication suspected = acute bacterial rhinosinusitis with proptosis, periorbital swelling, cranial nerve palsy, and/or severe headache
 
 chronic rhinosinusitis - presence of two or more symptoms of sinusitis for greater than 12 weeks, plus signs of inflammation such as turbinate edema,

Benefits of antibiotics, even in bacterial illness, are mild. Complete cure/resolution of symptoms could take up to 14 days or longer.\n\nIf severe infection or over 65, antibiotic of choice is amoxicillin/ clavulanate 2000 mg/125 mg ER tablet PO q12h x 10 days. Take with food or milk.\n\nIf younger than 65 with non-severe infection, can use amoxicillin/ clavnulanate 875/125 mg PO q12h x 5 days.  Take with food or milk.\n\nIf penicillin-allergic, use doxycycline, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or clindamycin plus cefixime or cefpodoxime.  Do not use macrolides or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole due to resistance.\n\nIf fails to start to improve after 7 days or significant worsening, reassess for complications.
